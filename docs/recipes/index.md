# Recipes

Differential expression analyses and gene set enrichmenet analyses can
be very varied in terms of their performance, analysis, and visualization.

I wanted to make this tool easy to use with default settings but configurable
to different forms of visualizations.

Here are some recipes that I use for different forms of GSEA visualizations.

```{toctree}
enriched
depleted
mixed
